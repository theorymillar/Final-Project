# Final-Project

## What is this app?

This app gives people access to types of CPR for different animals. Many animals that are taken to the animal ER and don't survive could have been saved if the owner had known how to conduct CPR on them. This app makes the different types of CPR accessible because it is difficult to find information on animal CPR. My hope is that with the use of this app many pet's lives will be saved.

This app is intended for anyone who owns a pet or spends a lot of time around animals. You never know when you might need to perform CPR on an animal, so it is always good to be prepared.

## Process

For this project, I started by collecting links to all of the information I would be using so I would be sure to cite my sources in the future. I kept those in a notes document for safe keeping. My next step was to set up my storyboard, I started with a couple main view controllers and one view controller for each animal. I went to Paul for help on something and he suggested I use a tableViewController instead of many different view controllers. This would make it easier for me to work on in the end, and it would make the app run much faster, but I would be more work for me at first. I was skeptical at first, but ended up going with Paul's suggestion. 

My biggest issues came from working on the tableViewController, including one issue that took me several days to solve. I used my final project from last semester as a guideline for much of this app, but still ran into issues with it. It turned out that using a tableViewController was not as easy as I thought. I created a struct to organize all of the data I would be putting in the new viewController. This included: the animal name, a url to the animal's wiki page, the actual instructions for CPR for that animal, and an image of the animal. The most difficult part of the project was getting each bit of information from the struct to actually show up in the new viewController. As you can see, it all worked out in the end.
