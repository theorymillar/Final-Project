# Final-Project

## What is this app?

This app gives people access to types of CPR for different animals. Many animals that are taken to the animal ER and don't survive could have been saved if the owner had known how to conduct CPR on them. This app makes the different types of CPR accessible because it is difficult to find information on animal CPR. My hope is that with the use of this app many pet's lives will be saved.

This app is intended for anyone who owns a pet or spends a lot of time around animals. You never know when you might need to perform CPR on an animal, so it is always good to be prepared.
