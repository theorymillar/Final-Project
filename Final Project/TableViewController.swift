Lay the dog on its right side and extend the head to align with its neck, then open its mouth and pull its tongue forward\n3. If there is no breathing hold the mouth closed and blow 4-5 small breaths into the dog's nose\n4. Check for a heartbeat before performing chest compressions\n5. Place the heel of your palm over the dog's heart, intertwine your fingers, and lock your elbows\n6. Give 30 compressions and then 2-3 rescue breaths until the dog is breathing again and you feel a heartbeat", image: "dog")

Pyll the tongue to the front of the mouth, then close the mouth and hold it shut\n3. Straighten out the neck and breathe short puffs of air into the nose every 4-5 seconds\n4. After 3-5 breaths lay the cat on its right side to prepare for chest compressions\n5. Place your thumb and fingers from both hands on either side of its chest\n6. Quickly squeeze and release about 15 times every 10 seconds, give an extra breath every 10 compressions", image: "cat")

If the lizard is not breathing place it on its back and place your fingers on either side of its ribcage\n3. Gently press with your fingers until more water comes out of its mouth and it begins breathing again\n4. If the lizard is still not breathing very carefully place your lips over its mouth and force air into its lungs until it begins to breathe again", image: "lizard")

Begin by laying the snake on its back\n2. Gently use a flat hand to tap up and down on the snakes chest to stimulate breathing\n3. Continue these gently compressions until the snake begins breathing again", image: "snake")

Place the goldfish in a clean containing filled with water from its tank\n3. Hold the fish in your hand and gently remove any dirt or debris from its sides and back\n4. Use your fingers to gently open the fishes gills, you can also massaging the fish's underbelly to stimulate air flow\n5. Move the goldfish close to the oxygenated water of an air stone\n6. To help your fish recover you can add one teaspoon of salt per gallon of water, keep your fish in the salt water for 1-3 minutes before moving it back to its main tank", image: "goldfish")

Check for windpipe blockage, if there is blockage use your finger or a cotton swab to clear the windpipe\n3. If there is a heartbeat but no breathing or blockage position the bird so you can deliver rescue breaths\n4. Seal your lips around the birds beak and nostrils and quickly deliver five soft breaths\n5. If the bird doesn't begin to breathe administer chest compressions by blasing 1-3 fingers on the middle chest bone try to do 40-60 compressions in a minute\n6. Continue a pattern of 5 breaths and 10 compressions until the bird regains breathing and heartbeat", image: "bird")

Check the airway for anything blocking it, if obstructions are found remove them\n2. Rub the foal vigorously with towels for 30 seconds to attempt to stimulate breathing, if this doesn't work tickle the foal's nostrils or ears\n3. If the foal still isn't breathing, position it on its right side and place the mask over the nose and mouth of the foal\n4. Squeeze the bag with two hands 10-20 times per minute, after 30 seconds of these compressions check for a heartbeat, if it is less than 40 beats per minute prepare to do chest compressions\n5. Stand over the foal and place your hands just behind its triceps at the highest point of the thorax\n6. Use your entire body weight to perform compressions at a rate of 80-120 a minute, if possible have someone take over for you every two minutes until the foal has a heartbeat of over 60 beats per minute", image: "horse")

Listen to the rabbit's chest to check for a heartbeat, if there is no heartbeat or breathing continue with CPR\n4. Tilt the rabbit's head back to open the airway\n5. Hold the mouth of the rabbit closed and seal your lips around the rabbit's nose\n6. Quickly blow 5 small breaths into the rabbit\n7. Check for a heartbeat by placing your finger on the large vein on the inside of the rabbit's back leg\n8. If no heartbeat is detected place your place your thumb at the top of the rabbit's chest and gently compress once every second\n9. After one minute of compressions give the rabbit 5 more breaths and repeat until the rabbit regains consciousness", image: "rabbit")
